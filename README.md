# turtle
I found the python turtle package online and figured I would play around with it. Very silly stuff but fun to code nonetheless. I made these awhile ago for fun and to get myself back in the coding mindset after summer break from school. 
the turtle_game file is esentially an animation using the turtle package. the 2 turtles line up and they each roll a dice behind the scene. Which ever has the highest roll moves forward until they are passed the line and win. 
The turtle_math file is very similar execpt the player has to answer simple math questions to progess along the screen.
